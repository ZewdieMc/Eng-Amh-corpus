This corpus consists of Amharic-English parallel sentences (segments) from 
various sources. This corpus is larger in size than previously compiled corpora. 
It is released for research purposes and can be used to train or support 
Amharic-English machine translation systems. Thus, the corpus is divided into 
training, development and test sets.

All the documents in the corpus are documents which have been made publicly 
available in the Web. In this distribution, for copyright reasons, the order of 
sentences are shuffled. By downloading this corpus you agree that the corpus should 
only be used for research purposes.
